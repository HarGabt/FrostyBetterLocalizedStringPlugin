# Frosty Better Localized String Plugin
A work in progress, terrible and buggy. But works fine.

# Install
Download from releases, extract and put all files in your Frosty Editor's Plugin folder.

# What it do
- Switch language directly in the editor
- Copy and paste now use Windows clipboard, not the object clipboard built-in Frosty
- Chinese font support
- Support input Enter
- A better and less buggy Import that also support excel and json.
- A better and less buggy Export that ONLY SUPPORT JSON right now.
- I do not promise all these works
